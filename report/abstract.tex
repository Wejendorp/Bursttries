\begin{abstract}
With the scaling of CPUs more focusing on increases in the number of cores, highly
parallelizable data structures are of increasing importance.

This project seeks to explore the implementation tradeoffs in parallelising the
burst trie datastructure, which has been shown to be on par with hashmaps in
both speed and space consumption. The burst trie provides fast sorted access to
strings and integers, however different bucket types have different advantages
and disadvantages.

By comparing different tradeoffs needed to implement partial functionalities,
specialized data structures are developed. Depending on the level of parallelism,
distribution of insertions/searches and removals, and the distribution of the
inserted data, different variations excel. This means evaluating the
modifications needed to make the trie work as a threadsafe set-, multiset- or
map container.

% REWRITE
In this project a simple locked burst trie is implemented, allowing 
speed-ups of up to a factor ? for insertions, and a factor 6 for 
searches.

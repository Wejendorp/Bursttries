Introduction
============
My datastructures bachelor project.
Different implementations of burst trie datastructure, testing against the STL implementations.

For threaded testing, a non-standard implementation is used, since the STL does not provide any thread-safety.

Dependencies
============

The randomized testing depends on the GNU Scientific Library.
And the thread-safe implementations depend on the LibAtomic_ops project.
